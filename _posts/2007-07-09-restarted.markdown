Now I have a reason to write in English, don't I^^




 




the first day of the english camp is kind of a failure to raise my interest.




nothing exciting (i don't know what's going to be in the next few days, but today, it is dissatisfying)




the teacher and the volunteer are both good




but there is definitely something wrong with the organization




with no one breaking the ice, we'll be kept waiting and wasting a lot of time later on




i tried




i'll keep trying tomorrow




see if there's any difference at that moment...
