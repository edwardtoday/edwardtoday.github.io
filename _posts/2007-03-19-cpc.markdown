One more's been "forced" to join CPC. Lucky not to be the one^^


Sounds so ridiculous that he's treated so because of using his laptop, in his room, during leisure time.


Till now i've never been seen working on mine in my room^^


What is the connection between breaking the rules and joining a party?


Actually, there's no such connectiong at all.


To be a much more powerful and influential party with more wise members, the party seems to be less human-centered.


An educated won't change his view of the party by force but by his observation.


Still thinking about this.
